Vulkan code
You may need to move the should close method in the VWindow.cpp file
by one line as sometimes an error occurs but it doesnt matter if
you move the method down one line and back to the same place. As
long as it is not above the other functions it will work.

You will need to change the bat file to match the source of the shaders on your system for the shaders to auto compile before running
